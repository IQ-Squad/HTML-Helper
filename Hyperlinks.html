		<h2>How to add Hyperlinks?</h2>
		<p>To insert a link, the tag that we're going to use is very easy to remember: (a). However, an attribute, href, to it to indicate the page the link should lead to.

For example, the code below is a link that leads to Google, located at the address http://www.google.com:

(a href="http://www.google.com")Google(/a)
We're going to include this link in a paragraph. So here's how you reproduce the example in the next figure:

(p)Hello. Do you want to visit the website (a href="http://www.google.com")Google(/a)?(br /) It's a good website! ;-)(/p)
By default, the link is highlighted in blue. If you've already opened the page, the link is displayed in purple.
We'll see how to change this appearance when we study CSS.

If you want to make a link to another site, you can just copy its address (called a URL) inhttp://. Note that some links sometimes start withhttps://(secure websites) or other prefixes (ftp://, etc.).

If you make a link to a website that has an address that is a little strange with occurrences of '&', as in: http://www.site.com/?data=15&name=mateo21, you will have to replace every "&" by "&amp;" in your link as follows: http://www.site.com/?data=15&amp;name=mateo21  .

You will notice no difference, yet this is necessary if you want your web page to be correctly constructed in HTML5.

The links that we have seen are called absolute links since the full address is shown. We are now going to see that we can write the links in a somewhat different way which will be useful for making links between the pages of our website.</p>
